# test

#### 1

go into the package without `aria`...

```
cd no-aria
yarn 
node run.js
```

You should see it run for a few seconds... and product a manifest and .js file

#### 2

Now into the one without `aria`...

```
cd ../includes-aria
yarn
node run.js
```

and boom! NOTHING produced. Is this re-producable on your machine?
